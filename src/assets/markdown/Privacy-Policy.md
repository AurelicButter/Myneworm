    In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information 
    without your consent, including, for example:
    <ul>
        <li>
            If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way

        </li>
        <li>
            If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the

                We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority
                to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you
                for the purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your identity from the information
                already maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the
                purposes of verifying your identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such
