Markdown is a commonly used markup language used to stylize and format text. This help is not meant to be an exhaustive guide, but a starting point to help start your customization journey.

The most common uses utilize specific symbols. However, HTML also works within a markdown display and is sometimes required for specific usecases.

## Text Formatting

There are a few common ways to change the style of the text.

`**Bold**` - **For bold text**

`*Italics*` - *For italicises text*

`<u>Underline</u>` - <u>For underlined text</u>

`~~Strikethrough~~` - ~~For strikethrough text~~

`***<u>Bold and Italics</u>***` - <u>***You can even combine effects into one!***</u>

## Sectioning

### Headings
For heading, there are six levels available. The level selected is how many `#` are placed in front of the text. (The guide sections utilize H1-H3 for reference)

```
# Example of H1
###### Example of H6
```

### Code Blocks

Code blocks are useful in one of two ways:
- To show how nerdy you are with programming
- To leave things unformatted so others can see the magic inside

```
`Single line block`
```Multi-line block```
```

### Lists

Lists can either be ordered...

```
1. Ordered Example
2. Another ordered item
3. Order #3
```
...or unordered.

```
- Item A
- Item Z
- Item F
```

## Custom Content

You can also include images and links into your markdown sections.
