### Database

#### What is accepted in Myneworm's Database?
We accept any English translations for manga, light novels, and their adjacent book-based media that meets our database guidelines. 
Details on what we define as acceptable can be found on our <a href='/guidelines'>database guidelines</a> page.

#### Why can't I find X title?
Depending on the title, we might have missed it! Please review our <a href='/guidelines'>database guidelines</a> to double check 
if it qualifies. If it does, fill out a <a href="/book/correction">blank correction form here</a>!

#### Why aren't J-Novel Club Parts or Yen Press Chapters tracked?
J-Novel parts do not contain ISBN numbers while Yen Press Chapter releases are not entire books on there own. Both are ineligible
for tracking due to these conditions.

### Lists

#### How do I add/remove books from my wishlist?
To add a book to your wishlist, you'll need to mark the book as 'Wanted' in the owner status. To remove the book, change the owner status so that 'Wanted' is not selected.
