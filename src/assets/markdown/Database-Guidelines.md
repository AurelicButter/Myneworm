### Defining Formats <a name="definitions"></a>

We track a lot of books which comes with a lot of formats and there are a variety of ways to define them.
The definitions below are the general guidelines from what makes a book a manga and not a fanbook or vice versa.

#### What is a Manga <a name="manga"></a>

- Manga are comics created in Japan for the Japanese market
    - Similarly, Manhwa (South Korean) and Manhua (Chinese, Hong Kong, Taiwan) also apply if they are made for their respective markets
    - Manhwa from North Korea will not be accepted.
- Is licensed by a publisher in their respective markets. Self-publications are not considered publisher licensed.
- Distributed either through a physical or digital release
    - A physical release covers book types like traditional paperback and hardcover
    - Digital releases covers book types like ebooks and audiobooks

#### What is a Fanbook <a name="fanbook"></a>

- Fanbooks are extra books released in addition to the main series and contain several elements one would not find in a traditional book.
    - Fanbooks are often marked by having "Fanbook" in the title. But not having that descriptor can still make a book a fanbook.
- Fanbook must have at least a combination of these elements:
    - Art illustrations and/or sketches
    - Q&As from the author, illustrator, or other creative staff
    - Story and/or world details such as timelines and background information not present in the stories
    - Bonus manga and/or stories not relevant to the plot
        - Side stories and .5 volumes, while being bonus stories, have some relevance to the plot itself and therefore do not meet this requirement. 
        They would be classified based on their layout and contents (ie: manga or light novel)
- Is officially licensed by a publisher in their respective markets. 
    - Self-publications or fanzines/zines are not considered publisher or officially licensed.
- Distributed either through a physical or digital release
    - A physical release covers book types like traditional paperback and hardcover
    - Digital releases covers book types like ebooks and audiobooks

### Additional Books We Track <a name="additionalBooks"></a>

While we focus on manga and light novels, we also track various additional books which can be considered apart of a series' collection.

- Books containing a collection of short stories from an existing series within Myneworm (ie: .5 volumes, volumes marked as side stories)
- Fanbooks for existing series within Myneworm
- Books that do not meet previous guidelines but have a verifiable anime adaptation and are published in 1980 or beyond (ie: Shinsekai Yori or Another)

### Information Within a Myneworm Entry <a name="formInformation"></a>

#### ISBN Numbers <a name="isbn"></a>
All entries must have an ISBN-13 number as they are used as IDs across Myneworm.
- Digital books might have this listed as an E-ISBN. E-ISBN numbers are generally ISBN-13.
- Reissues, reprints, and deluxe editions are accepted as seperate entries, provided their ISBN-13 numbers are different from the original editions

#### Titles <a name="title"></a>
- The entry must use the English title and should contain a volume number and/or other identifying pieces
    - Any identifying information that is handled by other values should not be included in the title. (ie: manga, light novel, hardcover, ebook, etc...)
        - The only exceptions are fanbook entries which keep "Fanbook" as apart of their title.
    - Labels should be added in cases like exclusive editions and omnibuses, if they are not already included.
        - For example: Robotics;Notes Volume 1 [original title] should be labeled as Robotics;Notes Omnibus Volume 1 (Barnes & Noble Exclusive Edition) 
        [Myneworm title] since it combines Volume 1 and Volume 2 plus is an edition exclusive to Barnes & Noble.
    - Shorthand usage for words like "Volume" is possible as long as it is consistant with other series entries. If shorthand is used, it must be a common abbriviation. Generally, Myneworm uses "Vol." or "Volume".
    - Volume numbers should be at the end of the title. For example: The Ancient Magus Bride, Volume 4
        - Alternatively, if there are seperate parts or published chapters, those are defined similiarly in the title. Often, the title matches what the publishers have on their sites.
        - Examples: Ascendance of a Bookworm: Part 1 Volume 1 or Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World-, Chapter 4: The Sanctuary and the Witch of Greed, Vol. 5

#### Miscellaneous <a name="miscInfo"></a>
- The entry must be an English translation from a publisher entity
    - If a entry meets the criteria but the imprint/publisher is not in Myneworm, please note this in your correction.
- Entries must have a format (ie: manga, light novel) and a type (ie: paperback, ebook).
- Cover images used must be the finalized English cover in releases. Non-final covers or pre-existing original covers will not be accepted nor used as placeholders.
- Descriptions, cover images, and release dates can all be left empty if they do not exist yet.
- Entries must be complete books and not parts or chapter releases of future volumes.
